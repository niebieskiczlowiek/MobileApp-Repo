# Mobile Dex

A mobile app built around the PokeApi (https://pokeapi.co/). The app will imitate the Pokedex and will allow the user to browse and read information about different pokemon. The user can also sort through different categories like types, regions or generations and checkmark pokemon as favourite. Mobile Dex will also allow to build teams of up to 6 pokemon.

The user can also explore information about the regions and types themselves.
